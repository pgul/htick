0. the smapi and the fidoconfig package is required for the hpt package

1. Put the htick package in the directory where the other packages of fido
   linux reside:

   /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                             -> htick/
                             -> fidoconfig/

2. compile htick

You're ready. If you have a working fidoconfig, you can now use htick under
unix.
