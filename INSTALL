Please read the files (especially README.Makefiles) in the
husky-common (huskybse) package FIRST!

Unix:
-----

0. The smapi and the fidoconfig package are required for the htick package.

1. Put the htick package in the directory where the other packages of fido
   linux reside:

   /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                             -> fidoconfig/
                             -> htick/

2. Determine which makefile you need to use then compile and install fidoconfig
   using selected makefile, as this examples.
   Ex.1 (use ../huskymak.cfg for all packages):
        $ make
        $ make install

   Ex.2 (use compiler-specific makefile):
        $ cd linux
	$ make -f makefile.lnx
	$ make -f makefile.lnx install

You're ready. If you have a working fidoconfig, you can now use htick under
unix.
