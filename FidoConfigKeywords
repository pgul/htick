    Whether to autocreate areas like /filebase/gfd.app.edit (off) or
    /filebase/gfd/app/edit (on). If you want to configure this globally
    instead of on per-link basis, set this in the deflink section. For more

    e) delNotRecievedTIC

    If file not recieved, then remove TIC

    f) FileFixFSC87Subset 

    This boolean switch will change on a per link basis how TIC files 
    are processed. By default this switch is ON. htick will then operate
    only on FSC87-compliant keywords and ignore unknown keywords in the
    TIC file processed. 
    If this switch is set to OFF all implemented keywords will be used
    which can (and, in interaction with some tick processors, WILL) lead
    to severe problems. Unknown keywords found in a TIC file will make 
    htick stop processing that file.
    If you don't know what all this is about set FileFixFSC87Subset to
    ON for all your links. It won't hurt.
