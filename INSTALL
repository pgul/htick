Please read the files (especially INSTALL) in the
huskybse package FIRST!

Unix:
-----

0. The smapi and the fidoconfig package are required for the htick package.

1. Put the htick package in the directory where the other packages of fido
   linux reside:

   /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                             -> fidoconfig/
                             -> htick/

2. Determine which makefile you need to use then compile and install fidoconfig
   using selected makefile, as following examples:
   Ex.1 (use platfom-specific makefile):
	$ make -f makefile.lnx
	$ make -f makefile.lnx install
   Ex.2 (use common makefile and ../huskymak.cfg):
	$ make
	$ make install

You're ready. If you have a working fidoconfig, you can now use htick under
unix.
